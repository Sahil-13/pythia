### Manual Content Research Strategy

**Weekly Routine (1-2 hours)**:

1. **Sort by "Top This Week"** on each subreddit
   - Posts with 5K+ upvotes = high engagement topics
   - Check comment count (200+ comments = passionate discussion)
   - Screenshot/save top 10 posts per subreddit

2. **Analyze Engagement Patterns**:
   - What questions are people asking repeatedly?
   - Which myths/mysteries get most debate?
   - What philosophical concepts spark arguments?
   - Which time periods/cultures trend frequently?

3. **Mine Comments for Angles**:
   - Top comments reveal what audiences find most interesting
   - "Actually..." corrections = opportunity for myth-busting videos
   - Questions = direct video topic suggestions
   - Debates = multi-perspective video opportunities

4. **Track with Spreadsheet**:
   ```
   Topic | Subreddit | Upvotes | Comments | Video Angle | Priority
   ```
